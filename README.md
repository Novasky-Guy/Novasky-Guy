## Tell Me a Little Bit About Yourself :sunglasses:
I have been learning how to code for over 5 years now! Coding is something that i really do enjoy doing, ontop of that- i love videography, photography and anything with drones.

My goal in life is to become a full stack developer, and even though progress is coming along, i believe there is always more to learn!
